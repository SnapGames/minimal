# The Minimal Game Project

## Introduction

This minimalistic project exists to create and maintain a cvery simple game peoject template to start learning code with java with some entertainment of video game.
The goal is to provide some basic practices of game development from scratch by using simple classes and moreover, ithout any external framework, on ly using the 
java JDK 17+.

let's dive int osome code to understand what is provided by this project.

## Preface

I always wanted to develop a video game, since I was achild and knowing only the basic language on a [TI-99/4A from Texas Instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-99/4A "go ans see the wikipedia page for this antic computer").

![the Texas Instrument TI-99/4A'](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/TI99-IMG_7132_%28filter_levels_crop%29.jpg/220px-TI99-IMG_7132_%28filter_levels_crop%29.jpg)

Even with the famous "Extended Basic Cartridge", the only way to develop was to edit thousands of lines of code to create games.

Many years after, I start working as a Consultant on C, C++, Pascal, VBA and finally, Java.

But I've never develop any game ;)

So, I decided to learn by myself to try and code something. 

This small piece of code, even if its not the most beautiful one, is an experiment in this area.
